# Awful Things
Awful things found out there.

Here I'll be posting awful things like scripts & code that I believe could be malicious or that are proved to me malicious. Since my work is mainly on CMS and Blogging platforms those are the kind of platforms that I'll be targeting.

Below the scripts/code names (I have named some by the variables/functions they use), the platform where I found it and a link to the source code (withing GitHub of course).
